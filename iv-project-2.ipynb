    "As depicted on the heatmap, rainy weather conditions were predominant for accidents across each month. Conversely, occurrences were least frequent during cloudy weather, with no reported events in July and September. Similarly, analyzing the vehicle types involved in accidents, taxis were implicated in the majority of incidents, while fire trucks were less commonly involved.\n",

    "Which area presented the majority of taxi accidents during rainy days in June on Mondays at noon, 12am?\n",

    "Based on the created charts, concerning the data for taxi accidents during rainy days in June on Mondays at noon, it is clear that Manhattan experienced the highest number of incidents, demonstrating a significant majority. In comparison, Brooklyn, Queens and Bronx had similar accident counts, while Staten Island recorded no accidents under these specific conditions.\n",

    "On the heatmap we can see that rainy weather was the most frequent condition in each of the analyzed months. June displayed a relatively balanced distribution of different weather conditions. In July, the number of clear days notably increased compared to June, and interestingly, no cloudy days were observed. August stood out as the month with the highest frequency of rainy days. September followed a pattern similar to July, although with decrease in clear days.\n",

However, this pattern is not consistently observed for ambulances and fire trucks, where the number of injured people during accidents does not exhibit a clear distinction between weekends and weekdays.\n",

    "Is there a specific time of day when Manhattan experiences fewer accidents in comparison to other boroughs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the chart, it is noteworthy that Manhattan consistently records the highest number of accidents throughout the day. The distinction in comparison to other boroughs becomes less pronounced in the early morning hours. In fact, around 7 am, the number of accidents in Manhattan and the Bronx appears to be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 8 <br>\n",
    "Do drivers pay more attention on the road during bad weather in order to reduce the number of accidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the contributing factor of 'Driver Inattention/distraction' and considering the corresponding bar chart, it appears that drivers do not significantly increase their attention on the road during bad weather. Across all boroughs, rainy weather consistently emerges as the most frequent weather condition for accidents caused by driver inattention."
